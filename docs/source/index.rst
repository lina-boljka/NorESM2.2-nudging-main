.. warning::
  Before continuing with the installation of NorESM2.2 please be aware that this is a preliminary (in development) version of the model, which has not yet been released or properly tested. Thus, care must be taken when using the results of this model version (pre-release). Also, only a limited number of compsets is presently working.
